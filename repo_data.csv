If an attacker gains access to cache storage (e.g., filesystem, Memcached, Redis, etc.), they can construct a crafted payload, poison the cache, and execute Python code. NOTE: a third party indicates that exploitation is extremely unlikely unless the machine is already compromised; in other cases, the attacker would be unable to write their payload to the cache and generate the required collision",https://github.com/pallets-eco/flask-caching/pull/209#issuecomment-1136397937
"Styra Open Policy Agent (OPA) Gatekeeper through 3.7.0 mishandles concurrency, sometimes resulting in incorrect access control. The data replication mechanism allows policies to access the Kubernetes cluster state. During data replication, OPA/Gatekeeper does not wait for the replication to finish before processing a request, which might cause inconsistencies between the replicated resources in OPA/Gatekeeper and the resources actually present in the cluster. Inconsistency can later be reflected in a policy bypass.

**DISPUTED**A failure in the -fstack-protector feature in GCC-based toolchains 
that target AArch64 allows an attacker to exploit an existing buffer 
overflow in dynamically-sized local variables in your application 
without this being detected. This stack-protector failure only applies 
to C99-style dynamically-sized local variables or those created using 
alloca(). The stack-protector operates as intended for statically-sized 
local variables.

The default behavior when the stack-protector 
detects an overflow is to terminate your application, resulting in 
controlled loss of availability. An attacker who can exploit a buffer 
overflow without triggering the stack-protector might be able to change 
program flow control to cause an uncontrolled loss of availability or to
 go further and affect confidentiality or integrity. NOTE: The GCC project argues that this is a missed hardening bug and not a vulnerability by itself.

"** DISPUTED ** A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, was found in Intelbras MHDX 1004, MHDX 1008, MHDX 1016, MHDX 5016, HDCVI 1008 and HDCVI 1016 up to 20240401. This affects an unknown part of the file /cap.js of the component HTTP GET Request Handler. The manipulation leads to information disclosure. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The real existence of this vulnerability is still doubted at the moment. The identifier VDB-258933 was assigned to this vulnerability. NOTE: The vendor explains that they do not classify the information shown as sensitive and therefore there is no vulnerability which is about to harm the user.",https://github.com/netsecfish/intelbras_cap_js
"JJWT (aka Java JWT) through 0.12.5 ignores certain characters and thus a user might falsely conclude that they have a strong key. The impacted code is the setSigningKey() method within the DefaultJwtParser class and the signWith() method within the DefaultJwtBuilder class. NOTE: the vendor disputes this because the ""ignores"" behavior cannot occur (in any version) unless there is a user error in how JJWT is used, and because the version that was actually tested must have been more than six years out of date.",https://github.com/2308652512/JJWT_BUG
"LLVM 15.0.0 has a NULL pointer dereference in the parseOneMetadata() function via a crafted pdflatex.fmt file (or perhaps a crafted .o file) to llvm-lto. NOTE: this is disputed because the relationship between pdflatex.fmt and any LLVM language front end is not explained, and because a crash of the llvm-lto application should be categorized as a usability problem.",https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/67388
std::bad_alloc is mishandled in Precomp 0.4.8. NOTE: this is disputed because it should be categorized as a usability problem.,https://github.com/schnaader/precomp-cpp/issues/139
An issue in MiniZinc before 2.8.0 allows a NULL pointer dereference via ti_expr in a crafted .mzn file. NOTE: this is disputed because there is no common libminizinc use case in which an unattended process is supposed to run forever to process a series of atttacker-controlled .mzn files.,https://github.com/MiniZinc/libminizinc/commit/afe67acc20898e4308044b54c4acf7a08df544f0
"AdTran SRG 834-5 HDC17600021F1 devices (with SmartOS 11.1.1.1 and fixed in Version 12.1.3.1) have SSH enabled by default, accessible both over the LAN and the Internet. During a window of time when the device is being set up, it uses a default username and password combination of admin/admin with root-level privileges. An attacker can exploit this window to gain unauthorized root access by either modifying the existing admin account or creating a new account with equivalent privileges. This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands. NOTE: The vendor has disputed this, finding the report not applicable. According to AdTran, SSH has never been accessible (from WAN) on SmartOS official builds. Furthermore, the vendor adds that test build 11.1.0.101-202106231430 was never released to end users.",https://github.com/actuator/cve/blob/main/AdTran/CVE-2024-31970
"In the vrrp_ipsets_handler handler (fglobal_parser.c) of keepalived through 2.3.1, an integer overflow can occur. NOTE: this CVE Record might not be worthwhile because an empty ipset name must be configured by the user.",https://github.com/acassen/keepalived/issues/2447#issuecomment-2231329734
Async <= 2.6.4 and <= 3.2.5 are vulnerable to ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) while parsing function in autoinject function. NOTE: this is disputed by the supplier because there is no realistic threat model: regular expressions are not used with untrusted input.,https://github.com/caolan/async/blob/v3.2.5/lib/autoInject.js#L41
Gradio v4.36.1 was discovered to contain a code injection vulnerability via the component /gradio/component_meta.py. This vulnerability is triggered via a crafted input. NOTE: the supplier disputes this because the report is about a user attacking himself.,https://github.com/Aaron911/PoC/blob/main/Gradio.md
"Apache XML Security for C++ through 2.0.4 implements the XML Signature Syntax and Processing (XMLDsig) specification without protection against an SSRF payload in a KeyInfo element. NOTE: the project disputes this CVE Record on the grounds that any vulnerabilities are the result of a failure to configure XML Security for C++ securely. Even when avoiding this particular issue, any use of this library would need considerable additional code and a deep understanding of the standards and protocols involved to arrive at a secure implementation for any particular use case. We recommend against continued direct use of this library.",https://github.com/zmanion/Vulnerabilities/blob/main/CVE-2024-21893.md
Ghost through 5.85.1 allows remote attackers to bypass an authentication rate-limit protection mechanism by using many X-Forwarded-For headers with different values. NOTE: the vendor's position is that Ghost should be installed with a reverse proxy that allows only trusted X-Forwarded-For headers.,https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/releases
A SQL injection vulnerability in Mybatis plus versions below 3.5.6 allows remote attackers to obtain database information via a Boolean blind injection. NOTE: the vendor's position is that this can only occur in a misconfigured application; the documentation discusses how to develop applications that avoid SQL injection.,https://github.com/baomidou/mybatis-plus/issues/6167
"Pug through 3.0.2 allows JavaScript code execution if an application accepts untrusted input for the name option of the compileClient, compileFileClient, or compileClientWithDependenciesTracked function. NOTE: these functions are for compiling Pug templates into JavaScript, and there would typically be no reason to allow untrusted callers.",https://github.com/pugjs/pug/pull/3428
Issue in KeePassXC 2.7.7 allows an attacker (who has the privileges of the victim) to recover some passwords stored in the .kdbx database via a memory dump. NOTE: the vendor disputes this because memory-management constraints make this unavoidable in the current design and other realistic designs.,https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/issues/10784
KeePassXC 2.7.7 allows an attacker (who has the privileges of the victim) to recover cleartext credentials via a memory dump. NOTE: the vendor disputes this because memory-management constraints make this unavoidable in the current design and other realistic designs.,https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/issues/10784
joblib v1.4.2 was discovered to contain a deserialization vulnerability via the component joblib.numpy_pickle::NumpyArrayWrapper().read_array(). NOTE: this is disputed by the supplier because NumpyArrayWrapper is only used during caching of trusted content.,https://github.com/joblib/joblib/issues/1582
Vditor 3.10.3 allows XSS via an attribute of an A element. NOTE: the vendor indicates that a user is supposed to mitigate this via sanitize=true.,https://github.com/Vanessa219/vditor/blob/b3a14d6e4462b0c17141e1fcc66173264ada64e0/README_en_US.md?plain=1#L310
"In Symfony v7.07, a security vulnerability was identified in the FormLoginAuthenticator component, where it failed to adequately handle cases where the username or password field of a login request is empty.
